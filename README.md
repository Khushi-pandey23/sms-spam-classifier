<h1>SMS Spam Classifier</h1>

<p>This project is an SMS Spam Classifier that uses machine learning to identify and filter out spam messages from legitimate ones. The model is trained on a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (non-spam) and predicts the likelihood of new messages being spam.</p>

## Features
- Preprocesses SMS text data by cleaning and normalizing the text.
- Extracts features using techniques like TF-IDF vectorization.
- Trains a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) to classify SMS messages.
- Evaluates the model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for predicting whether an SMS message is spam.
